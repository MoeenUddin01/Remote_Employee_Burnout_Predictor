Project: Remote Employee Burnout Predictor
Author: Moeenuddin
Data Version: 2.0 (With Memory Features)

OVERVIEW:
Burnout is a cumulative process, not a single-day event. These 4 new 
columns were created to give the model "Historical Context," allowing 
it to see patterns over time rather than just isolated snapshots.

-----------------------------------------------------------
1. COLUMN: work_hours_7d_avg
-----------------------------------------------------------
- SOURCE: 'work_hours'
- LOGIC: Average of the last 7 days of work for each user.
- WHY IT MATTERS: High hours on a single Tuesday might just be a 
  deadline. However, a high 7-day average proves "Chronic Overwork."
- MODEL IMPACT: This acts as a 'Stamina' indicator. It helps the model 
  identify employees who are consistently over-extending themselves 
  without rest.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. COLUMN: fatigue_3d_sum
-----------------------------------------------------------
- SOURCE: 'fatigue_score'
- LOGIC: Total sum of fatigue scores over the last 3 days.
- WHY IT MATTERS: Fatigue is "sticky"—it carries over to the next day. 
  If the sum is high, the person is entering a "fatigue debt."
- MODEL IMPACT: This is a 'Recovery' indicator. It allows the model to 
  detect when stress is accumulating faster than the employee can 
  recover, which is a major precursor to burnout.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. COLUMN: is_weekend
-----------------------------------------------------------
- SOURCE: 'day_type'
- LOGIC: A Binary Flag (True/False) identifying rest days.
- WHY IT MATTERS: Working 8 hours on a Sunday is more draining than 
  working 8 hours on a Wednesday due to the lack of social recovery.
- MODEL IMPACT: This serves as a 'Boundary' indicator. It helps the 
  model "penalize" work hours that occur during traditional rest periods, 
  making the burnout prediction more sensitive to work-life balance.

-----------------------------------------------------------
4. COLUMN: meetings_7d_avg
-----------------------------------------------------------
- SOURCE: 'meetings_count'
- LOGIC: Average number of meetings per day over the last week.
- WHY IT MATTERS: Virtual meetings cause "Context Switching" fatigue. 
  A high weekly average indicates "Zoom Exhaustion."
- MODEL IMPACT: This is a 'Cognitive Load' indicator. It helps the 
  model understand the quality of work stress; high meetings often 
  correlate with high mental drain even if work hours are normal.

-----------------------------------------------------------
HOW THESE FEATURES HELP THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Pattern Recognition: Instead of just looking at raw numbers, the 
   model can now see "Trends" (e.g., Is fatigue going up or down?).
   
2. Noise Reduction: Daily spikes (like one late night) are smoothed 
   out by the 7-day averages, preventing the model from overreacting 
   to single events.

3. Better Decision Trees: The model can now create complex rules like:
   "IF (Work Hours > 8) AND (7-Day Average > 9) AND (is_weekend), 
   THEN (Burnout Risk = High)."

4. Proactive Prediction: Because these features track accumulation, 
   the model can predict burnout BEFORE it happens by watching the 
   3-day and 7-day trends rise.

HOW I CREATED THE NEW COLUMNS (Simplified)
===========================================================

1. CONFIRMATION OF DATA:
My dataset contains multiple records for each user (between 7 to 25 days 
per person). This allows me to calculate "Memory" features because I can 
see what the user did yesterday, the day before, and throughout the week.

2. THE CALCULATION STEPS:

A. Grouping by User (The "ID" Check)
   - First, I told the computer to group the data by 'user_id'. 
   - This ensures that when we calculate an average for "User A," we don't 
     accidentally use data from "User B."

B. Rolling Average (The "7-Day Window")
   - Column: 'work_hours_7d_avg'
   - How: The computer looks at the current row and the 6 rows above it. 
     It adds them up and divides by 7. 
   - Why: This shows the "Weekly Trend" instead of just a single busy day.

C. Cumulative Sum (The "3-Day Pile-up")
   - Column: 'fatigue_3d_sum'
   - How: The computer adds the fatigue score from today, yesterday, 
     and the day before. 
   - Why: This shows if tiredness is "piling up." If the number keeps 
     growing, the person is not resting enough.

D. Boolean Logic (The "Weekend Flag")
   - Column: 'is_weekend'
   - How: I checked the 'day_type' column. If it said "Weekend," the 
     new column gets a 'True' (1). If it said "Weekday," it gets a 'False' (0).
   - Why: Working on a Saturday is harder on the brain than working 
     on a Tuesday. This tells the AI that the day of the week matters.

3. WHY THIS HELPS THE MODEL:
Instead of just guessing burnout based on one photo (today), these 
columns allow the AI to watch a movie (the whole week). This makes the 
prediction much more accurate and "smarter."

PROJECT: Employee Burnout & Social Isolation Prediction
AUTHOR: [Your Name]

---------------------------------------------------------

1. COLUMN: effort_recovery_ratio
---------------------------------------------------------
Concept:
   This feature measures the balance between energy expenditure (Work) and energy restoration (Sleep). 
   Burnout is rarely caused by work alone; it is caused by work without recovery.

The Calculation (Formula):
   effort_recovery_ratio = work_hours / (sleep_hours + 0.1)
   *(Note: A buffer of 0.1 is added to sleep_hours to prevent division-by-zero errors).*

How to Interpret:
   - 1.0 - 1.2 (Healthy Zone): The employee is sleeping roughly as much as they work (e.g., 8h Work / 7.5h Sleep).
   - 1.5 - 1.9 (Warning Zone): The employee is working significantly more than they sleep (e.g., 9h Work / 5.5h Sleep).
   - > 2.0 (Critical Zone): The employee is working double their recovery time (e.g., 12h Work / 5h Sleep). This is a massive predictor of imminent burnout.

Why this helps the Model:
   A simple "Work Hours" column might treat 9 hours as "safe." But if the employee only slept 4 hours, 9 hours of work is dangerous. This ratio forces the model to see that context.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. COLUMN: context_switch_load
---------------------------------------------------------
Concept:
   This feature quantifies "Cognitive Load" or mental fragmentation. It tests the hypothesis that multitasking is more exhausting than deep work.

The Calculation (Formula):
   context_switch_load = app_switches * meetings_count

How to Interpret:
   - Low Score (0 - 50): Deep Focus. (e.g., 20 switches * 1 meeting). The employee had long blocks of uninterrupted time.
   - Medium Score (50 - 200): Fragmented Focus. (e.g., 40 switches * 4 meetings). A typical busy corporate day.
   - High Score (> 250): Chaos Mode. (e.g., 60 switches * 6 meetings). The employee was constantly interrupted, leading to high fatigue regardless of total hours worked.

Why this helps the Model:
   Two employees might both work 8 hours.
   - Employee A: 1 Meeting, 20 Switches. (Low Stress).
   - Employee B: 8 Meetings, 80 Switches. (High Stress).
   Without this column, the model sees them both as "8 Hours Work" and misses the risk. This feature exposes the hidden stress of interruptions.

---------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF IMPACT
---------------------------------------------------------
By adding these two columns, we transformed the dataset from a "Time Sheet" (tracking hours) into a "Behavioral Log" 
(tracking stress and balance). This significantly improved the Random Forest model's ability to distinguish between 
"Hard Working" (safe) and "Overwhelmed" (burnout risk).
