Project: Remote Employee Burnout Predictor
Author: Moeenuddin
Data Version: 2.0 (With Memory Features)

OVERVIEW:
Burnout is a cumulative process, not a single-day event. These 4 new 
columns were created to give the model "Historical Context," allowing 
it to see patterns over time rather than just isolated snapshots.

-----------------------------------------------------------
1. COLUMN: work_hours_7d_avg
-----------------------------------------------------------
- SOURCE: 'work_hours'
- LOGIC: Average of the last 7 days of work for each user.
- WHY IT MATTERS: High hours on a single Tuesday might just be a 
  deadline. However, a high 7-day average proves "Chronic Overwork."
- MODEL IMPACT: This acts as a 'Stamina' indicator. It helps the model 
  identify employees who are consistently over-extending themselves 
  without rest.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. COLUMN: fatigue_3d_sum
-----------------------------------------------------------
- SOURCE: 'fatigue_score'
- LOGIC: Total sum of fatigue scores over the last 3 days.
- WHY IT MATTERS: Fatigue is "sticky"—it carries over to the next day. 
  If the sum is high, the person is entering a "fatigue debt."
- MODEL IMPACT: This is a 'Recovery' indicator. It allows the model to 
  detect when stress is accumulating faster than the employee can 
  recover, which is a major precursor to burnout.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. COLUMN: is_weekend
-----------------------------------------------------------
- SOURCE: 'day_type'
- LOGIC: A Binary Flag (True/False) identifying rest days.
- WHY IT MATTERS: Working 8 hours on a Sunday is more draining than 
  working 8 hours on a Wednesday due to the lack of social recovery.
- MODEL IMPACT: This serves as a 'Boundary' indicator. It helps the 
  model "penalize" work hours that occur during traditional rest periods, 
  making the burnout prediction more sensitive to work-life balance.

-----------------------------------------------------------
4. COLUMN: meetings_7d_avg
-----------------------------------------------------------
- SOURCE: 'meetings_count'
- LOGIC: Average number of meetings per day over the last week.
- WHY IT MATTERS: Virtual meetings cause "Context Switching" fatigue. 
  A high weekly average indicates "Zoom Exhaustion."
- MODEL IMPACT: This is a 'Cognitive Load' indicator. It helps the 
  model understand the quality of work stress; high meetings often 
  correlate with high mental drain even if work hours are normal.

-----------------------------------------------------------
HOW THESE FEATURES HELP THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Pattern Recognition: Instead of just looking at raw numbers, the 
   model can now see "Trends" (e.g., Is fatigue going up or down?).
   
2. Noise Reduction: Daily spikes (like one late night) are smoothed 
   out by the 7-day averages, preventing the model from overreacting 
   to single events.

3. Better Decision Trees: The model can now create complex rules like:
   "IF (Work Hours > 8) AND (7-Day Average > 9) AND (is_weekend), 
   THEN (Burnout Risk = High)."

4. Proactive Prediction: Because these features track accumulation, 
   the model can predict burnout BEFORE it happens by watching the 
   3-day and 7-day trends rise.
